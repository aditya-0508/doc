# Installation 

### Initial setup

To set up EdgeChains, you will need to download the release jar.

### Downloading the release jar

> **Note:** EdgeChains requires Java version 17 or above to run. Please ensure that you have Java 17 installed on your system before proceeding.

You can download the release jars and associated files from the [latest release](https://github.com/arakoodev/EdgeChains/releases/tag/0.3.0). Make sure to download the `flyfly.jar`, `edgechain-app-VERSION_NUMBER.jar` and the `source code` zip file. Both jar files are necessary for running EdgeChains.

Once downloaded, Follow these steps:

1. Create a new folder in your desired location and add the jar files into the newly created folder.

2. Copy all the contents from the _Examples_ folder and paste to your folder. The _Examples_ folder includes all the jsonnet files and `EdgeChainApplication.java` file.    

4. Navigate to the directory in which you have extracted the files within the IntelliJ IDE.

> **Note:** You can use any IDE of your choice, but IntelliJ is recommended as it automatically indexes the project and selects the **Java SDK 17 or above**, which is required for EdgeChains. Additionally, ensure that you are using a **JBang project**. 

> Optionally, you may rename the file `EdgeChainApplication.java` to a name of your preference. You can then write your own code or modify the example implementation to meet your specific requirements.
