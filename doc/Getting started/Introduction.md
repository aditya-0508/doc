# Introduction

**EdgeChains** is an advanced framework designed for developing language model-powered applications. It offers a range of capabilities that enable developers to create applications with the following features:

**Data Integration**: Seamlessly connect language models with other data sources, allowing for rich and comprehensive information processing.

**Interactive Functionality**: Enable language models to interact with their environment, making applications more dynamic and responsive.

EdgeChains provides a set of powerful components that simplify working with language models. These components are designed to be modular and user-friendly, whether you are using the complete EdgeChains framework or incorporating specific components into your existing workflows.

In addition to the components, EdgeChains offers pre-built chains for common tasks. These ready-to-use chains allow for quick prototyping and easy implementation. For more complex applications and specific use cases, the framework allows for easy customization of existing chains or the creation of new ones using the available components.

EdgeChains empowers developers to leverage the full potential of language models, making it straightforward to integrate them into diverse applications and achieve desired outcomes.

## Get started

To get started with EdgeChains, follow the installation instructions outlined in the [Installation Guide](Installation.md). This guide will walk you through necessary steps to start building your own EdgeChains applications.
