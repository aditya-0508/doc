# EdgeChains

EdgeChains is a powerful framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models. It offers a comprehensive set of tools and functionalities that enable developers to leverage the capabilities of language models effectively. 

It is an open-source tool which helps you compose a variety of language chains (such as, chat system, QA system, etc) by LLMs. Edgechains also has a framework for building  Reasoning+Acting (shortly, ReAct) chains. By providing a streamlined workflow and addressing common challenges, EdgeChains empowers developers to build robust and scalable applications with ease.

### Key features and benefits

- **Simplified Integration**: EdgeChains abstracts away the complexities of working with language models, providing a user-friendly interface for integration into applications. It handles the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on application logic.

- **Efficient Prompting**: EdgeChains offers advanced prompt management and manipulation capabilities. Developers can easily define prompts, modify them, and control the interaction with language models to achieve desired outputs.

- **Scalability and Performance**: EdgeChains is designed for scalability and performance. It can handle large-scale applications with ease, leveraging parallelism and distributed computing to achieve optimal throughput.

### Use Cases   

EdgeChains finds applications in a wide range of scenarios, including, but not limited to:

1. **Document Analysis and Summarization**: Extracting key information from documents, generating summaries, and performing content analysis.

2. **Chatbot Development**: Building conversational agents that can interact with users, provide responses, and offer personalized experiences.

3. **Code Analysis and Automation**: Assisting developers in analyzing code, generating code snippets, and automating repetitive programming tasks. 

Detailed implementation of examples can be found at **[Examples](https://www.arakoo.ai/doc/category/Examples)**.

### Compatibility and Dependencies

EdgeChains is designed to be compatible with a wide range of programming languages and frameworks. It can seamlessly integrate into projects using Java, Python, JavaScript, and other popular languages. EdgeChains aims to keep dependencies minimal to ensure a smooth integration process. It leverages industry-standard libraries and frameworks to minimize the impact on your existing codebase. By reducing external dependencies, EdgeChains offers a lightweight solution that doesn't introduce unnecessary complexities or conflicts with your existing project dependencies.
