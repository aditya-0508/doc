title: "Generative AI is changing the way we manage configs. Are you ready?"
desc: "RAG stack (Retriever Augmented Generative AI) is a comprehensive solution for deploying and optimizing large language models (LLMs) in production applications. To effectively integrate LLMs in production, it requires an advanced optimization layer akin to Cloudflare, encompassing LLM routers, token compressors, token cache, guardrails, data redaction servers, and structured output transformers. Arakoo is the pioneering LLM optimization cloud built on a Kubernetes-derived programming model, enabling rapid deployment and faster time-to-market compared to other solutions available. 
With Arakoo, you can unlock the full potential of LLMs for your production environments."

  desc: "Arakoo is an open source community, supporting existing open source tools and communities wherever possible! We believe that the success of LLM & Generative AI applications in production lies in its ability to manage prompts & chain algorithms. We also understand that maintaining a business based on Generative AI is already tedious enough without having to add hardcoded prompts or vendor lock-ins in this piece of infrastructure. That's why Arakoo believes in building Open-Source Community based infrastructure (like EdgeChains)."
