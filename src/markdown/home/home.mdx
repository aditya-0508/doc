title: "Are you ready for the impact of generative AI on configuration management?"
desc: "RAG stack (Retriever Augmented Generative AI) is a comprehensive solution for deploying and optimizing large language models (LLMs) in production applications. To effectively integrate LLMs in production, it requires an advanced optimization layer akin to Cloudflare, encompassing LLM routers, token compressors, token cache, guardrails, data redaction servers, and structured output transformers. Arakoo is the pioneering LLM optimization cloud built on a Kubernetes-derived programming model, enabling rapid deployment and faster time-to-market compared to other solutions available. 
With Arakoo, you can unlock the full potential of LLMs for your production environments."

  span: "And what do we build?"
  desc: "Arakoo is an open source community, supporting existing open source tools and communities wherever possible! 
  We're all about empowering the success of LLM & Generative AI applications in production by mastering prompt and chain algorithm management. We get it, running a Generative AI business can be tough, and dealing with hardcoded prompts or vendor lock-ins only adds to the hassle. That's why Arakoo is all about building infrastructure based on Open-Source Community principles, (like the EdgeChains)."
