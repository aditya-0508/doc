desc: "RAG stack (Retriever Augmented Generative AI) for production LLM applications. Integrating with LLMs in production needs an unprecedented optimization layer similar to Cloudflare - such as LLM routers, token compressors, token cache, guardrails, data redaction servers and structured output transformers. Arakoo is the first LLM optimization cloud built around a Kubernetes-derived programming model that enables a faster go-live than anything else out there."

  desc: "Arakoo is an open source community, supporting existing open source tools and communities wherever possible! We believe that the success of LLM & Generative AI applications in production lies in its ability to manage prompts & chain algorithms. We also understand that maintaining a business based on Generative AI is already tedious enough without having to add hardcoded prompts or vendor lock-ins in this piece of infrastructure. That's why Arakoo believes in building Open-Source Community based infrastructure (like EdgeChains)."
